<h2><strong>Julian Ruiz</strong></h2><br>
<h3>Industrial, Web & UI/UX Designer.</h3>


It’s me, Julián Ruiz, passionate about design, illustration, and code. I love to change environments, learn and explore new horizons exploiting my skills and challenge myself.

The design shows me the way to the physical and virtual world.
The illustration shows me my thoughts and ideas.
The code recreates the bases.
I am helpful, generous and resilient under stress, I work with initiative, commitment, and empathy for the effective fulfillment of the project at hand. I am consistently observant and punctual, and I adopt my work with a good attitude. As a team player, creative and innovative individual, I bring with me just short of 5 years of experience in industrial and web design.
